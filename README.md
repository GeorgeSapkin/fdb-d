# FoundationDB D API #

### Requirements ###

* FoundationDB [clients](https://foundationdb.com/get) installed
* `dmd` and `dub` to build

### Notes ###

It has been ripped out of a working project so it's missing unit testing and sample usage for now. It's based on FoundationDB [Node.js API](https://foundationdb.com/key-value-store/documentation/api-node.html) and you have to be familiar with FoundationDB in general to use it. Certain features (parts of Tuple layer) that we don't use have not been implemented yet.

This has only been used/tested on Fedora 20/21 x64 and Ubuntu 14.04 x64.
